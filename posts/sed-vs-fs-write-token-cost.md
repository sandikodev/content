# SED vs fs_write: Token Cost Analysis

When working with text manipulation in development workflows, choosing the right tool can impact both efficiency and cost, especially when using AI-assisted development tools.

## The Comparison

### SED Command

- **Token Cost**: ~50 tokens per operation
- **Learning Curve**: Steep regex syntax
- **Flexibility**: High for pattern matching
- **Cross-platform**: Limited on Windows

### fs_write Tool

- **Token Cost**: ~120 tokens per operation
- **Learning Curve**: Intuitive API
- **Flexibility**: Structured operations
- **Cross-platform**: Universal support

## Use Cases

**Choose SED when:**

- Simple pattern replacements
- Unix/Linux environments
- Batch text processing
- Minimal token usage priority

**Choose fs_write when:**

- Complex file operations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Structured content management
- AI-assisted development

## Conclusion

While SED offers lower token costs, fs_write provides better developer experience and reliability across platforms. The choice depends on your specific workflow and environment constraints.
